	<h1>How to play BlackJack</h1>
	<p>

OBJECTIVE <br><br>
The objective of the game is to beat the dealer. If your cards total higher than the dealer's cards without going over 21 you win. You are not trying to get close to 21. If your hand or the dealer's hand goes over 21 you "Bust." If you bust you automatically lose. If the dealer busts and you don't, you win. The player must act first. If the player busts he loses regardless if the dealer busts or not.<br><br>

THE GAME <br><br>
This game is only played in a single deck of cards. You are able to continue the game as long as there is enough cards in the deck to be dealt. Once the deck is empty or don't have enough cards, the game is over. Your total wins and losses are recorded.

HAND<br><br>
A player is dealt two cards face up. The dealer receives one card face up and one card is not shown. These are called a "Hand". Each cards in hand is totalled and gives you the value of your hand.<br><br>

CARD VALUES<br><br>
The suits of the cards have no affect on the game. Cards 2 - 10 are counted at face value without regards to their suit. All face cards have a value of ten. An ace can count as either one or eleven.<br><br>

A hand that contains an ace is referred to as a Soft Hand because the value can change. If you draw to a soft hand and the three cards total a number where counting an ace as eleven puts you over 21 then the hand becomes a hard hand.
<br><br>
<em>Example:</em> You are dealt an ace and a three. You have 4 or 14. If you then draw a ten you now have a hard 14 because if you count the ace as 11 you would have 25, which would bust you.<br><br>

If you or the dealer is dealt an Ace and a ten-value card you have 21 known as a 'BLACKJACK'.<br><br>

If you get the 'BLACKJACK' you win.<br><br>

If you and the dealer have 'BLACKJACK' it is a draw.<br><br>

If only the dealer has blackjack the player will lose.<br><br>

STARTING THE GAME<br><br>
A player is dealt two cards face up. The dealer receives one card face up and one card is not shown. After the cards are dealt the dealer will ask the player in turn to make their decision.<br><br>

HITTING<br><br>
To take a hit means that you want to draw another card. After getting another card, the value of the card is added to the total currently in your hand.<br><br>

STANDING<br><br>
Once you are satisfied with either your first two cards or after hitting, you signal the dealer that you wish to stand.<br><br>
